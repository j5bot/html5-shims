Working on a WebWorker shim implemented with Google Gears, I realized how many other HTML5 features would be needed for it to be totally complete to the spec.

I have realized that it would be good to start collecting some of the available shims and compatibility libraries into a coherent whole.

I will begin by posting the WebWorker shim I have created and then adding the others needed to complete WebWorker as they are modified or re-implemented to allow for cohesion.
