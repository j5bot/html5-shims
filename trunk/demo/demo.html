	<h1>Web Workers API Shim (on top of Google Gears)</h1>
	<h2>Credits</h2>
	<p class="authors">Jonathan 'J5' Cook</p>
	<p>I wouldn't be working on this if <a href="http://webreflection.blogspot.com">Andrea Giammarchi</a> hadn't pointed me at it.</p>
	
	<h2>Demo</h2>
	<p>Click the button below to demo this thing.</p>
		
	<textarea rows="8" cols="100" id="demoworkers"></textarea>
	<p><input type="button" name="demo" value="DEMO" onclick="demo()" /></p>
	
	<h2>Information</h2>
	<p>A class/constructor implements the worker's internal state (<a href="WorkerGlobalScope.js">WorkerGlobalScope</a>) according to the <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-workers/current-work/">WebWorker API</a></p>
	<p>A worker class which instantiates the new worker thread and and the managing class (<a href="DedicatedWorker.js">DedicatedWorker</a>)</p>
	
	<h3>What's Not Done</h3>
	<p>Some stuff from the API is not yet implemented:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Implementing the communication between Worker and WorkerGlobalScope via MessagePort objects...</li>
		<li>implementing SharedWorker (which requires MessagePorts and may or may not be possible ... we'll see)</li>
		<li>onerror handlers</li>
		<li>The internal list of Documents that the API says the Worker keeps.  That part seriously doesn't make sense to me.</li>
		<li>The close() method of the worker which tells the WorkerGlobalScope to quit, etc.</li>
		<li>The database methods available to WebWorkers via HTML5</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
	<p>A few items I learned working on this code:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Gears HttpRequest object does not support synchronous/blocking downloads.  Solution is to prefetch what your worker needs and run the scripts as they are asked for, rather than ask, load and run.</li>
		<li>Gears JS environment is missing some methods from Array object ... shift() and splice() didn't work for me at all.</li>
		<li>Safari 4 native implementation of Worker doesn't support nested workers (inner/child workers)</li>
		<li>throw new Error(...) is the new alert(...)</li>
	</ul>
		
	<h3>A Peek at the Worker's Internal Code</h3>

	<script type="text/javascript" src="/svn/trunk/src/DedicatedWorker.js"></script>
	<script type="text/javascript">
		function demo() {
			var w = new Worker("workers/child.js");
			
			// take a peek at the inner workings
			document.getElementById("workercode").innerHTML = w._source;
			
			w.onmessage = function(event) {
				document.getElementById("demoworkers").value+=event.data + "\n";
			};
